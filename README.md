# Lightweight Asynchronous HTTP Client (LAHC)

This is a very simple and lightweight HTTP client for Java 8+. For bigger projects, use other HTTP client libraries like [Apache's HTTPComponents Client](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-5.1.x/) or [OkHttp](https://squareup.github.io/okhttp).
